# task-tracker-2000

## Description

I wanted to create a workday planner that color-codes past, present, and future time-blocks, and displays saved tasks when the page is loaded. For loops were helpful in getting elements from the HTML as well as setting the text content for time-blocks with saved tasks. I also practiced using jQuery, which helped to keep the script file more concise.

## Usage

To use the scheduler, simply enter a task in the text area of the desired timeblock. The timeblocks are highlighted different colors for past, present, and future timeblocks. To save a task, click the button with the save icon to the right of the text area. Saved tasks will display automatically when page loads. To clear a task, delete text from textbox and save. Or, click the button located below scheduler to clear entire form and delete saved tasks from local storage.
